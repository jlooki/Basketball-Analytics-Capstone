# Basketball-Analytics-Capstone
A Python-based basketball analytics project analyzing player performance metrics including Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Win Shares (WS), and Usage Percentage (USG%). The project performs data cleaning, statistical analysis, correlation studies, and visualization to uncover relationships between key basketball performance indicators.
This project explored the relationships between key basketball performance metrics using a synthetic dataset of 150 players. After cleaning the data and removing outliers, statistical analyses revealed a strong positive correlation between Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Win Shares (WS), suggesting that more efficient players tend to contribute more wins to their teams. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between Usage Percentage (USG%) and Turnover Percentage (TOV%), indicating that players who use the ball more effectively tend to commit fewer turnovers. The regression model demonstrated that PER and Minutes Played (MP) are significant predictors of Win Shares. The visualizations provided further insight into the distribution and interaction of these variables. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of efficiency and usage in evaluating player contributions in basketball and provides a foundation for more advanced sports analytics.
